## 🔍 Overview

**Path Finding Visualizer** is a tool designed to help developers, students, and enthusiasts understand how search algorithms operate internally.

It visually demonstrates:

- How nodes are visited
- How algorithms expand their search space
- How shortest paths are formed
- How walls/obstacles affect traversal

Three algorithms are supported:

- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Weighted Shortest Path)**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Algorithm Visualizations** — Watch algorithms run step-by-step  
- 🟥 **Interactive Grid** — Add/remove walls and restructure paths  
- 🎯 **Dynamic Start/End Node Selection**  
- ⚡ **Smooth Animations** for every exploration step  
- 🔁 **Reset & Rerun** any number of times  
- 📱 **Fully Responsive UI** built with Tailwind  
- 🧩 **Clean TypeScript Codebase**
